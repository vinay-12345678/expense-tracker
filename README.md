## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js >= 20
- npm or yarn
- React Native development environment setup
  - For iOS: Xcode and CocoaPods
  - For Android: Android Studio and JDK

### Installation

1. **Navigate to project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd "/Users/vinaybansal/Documents/personal/ExpenseTracker"
   ```

2. **Dependencies are already installed**, but if you need to reinstall:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Running the App

#### Android
1. Start Metro bundler:

   npm start
   ```

2. In a new terminal, run:
   ```bash
   npm run android
   ```
   Make sure you have an Android emulator running or device connected.

#### iOS

**Note**: Due to the space in the workspace path, CocoaPods installation may have issues. Here are solutions:

**Option 1**: Install pods with proper environment variables
```bash
export LANG=en_US.UTF-8
export LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8
cd ios
pod install
cd ..
```

**Option 2**: Move the project to a path without spaces
```bash
# Move to a simpler path
mv "/Users/vinaybansal/Documents/personal/ExpenseTracker" ~/ExpenseTracker
cd ~/ExpenseTracker
cd ios && pod install && cd ..
```

Then run:
```bash
npm start
# In another terminal
npm run ios
```
